As a journalism student who has interviewed dozens of young Indians across the country, I've identified several key reasons for this alienation:</p><h4>Perceived Irrelevance</h4><p>Many young people feel that mainstream politics doesn't address issues that matter to them. While politicians debate ideological positions, young voters are concerned about practical issues like employment opportunities, educational quality, mental health support, and climate change.</p>"
